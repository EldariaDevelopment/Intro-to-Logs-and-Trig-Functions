# Logs
## Introduction to Logs
Logs are the inverse of exponents, we use the notation of $\log_a$ to represent logs. 
## Log usage
How we use logs is that when we have spome $a^b$ where $b$ is the exponent to some a, some $\log_a a^b = b$
##  Log rules 
We won't take too much time going over examples on log rules but we will be proving / deriving all of them. 


#### Product Property: $$\log_b (x\cdot{y}) = \log_b{x}+\log_b{y}$$
#### Power Property: $$\log_b\left(x^k\right)=k\cdot\log_b{x}$$
#### Quotient Property: 
$$\log_b \left(
\frac{x}{y}
\right) = \log_b{x}-\log_b{y}$$

#### The Change of Base Property: $$\log_a{x}=\frac{\log_b{x}}{\log_b{a}}$$

## Introduction to Trig Functions
Trig function describe some ratios on the unit circle, we have three main trig functions, $\sin$, $\cos$, $\tan$
